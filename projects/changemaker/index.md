### Challenge 3: Collect Resources <a name="ch3"></a>

<center>**For this challenge, you will be building a list of resources about your issue area. This should include textbooks, books, articles, news pieces, documentaries, videos, podcast episodes, videos, and more. Ideally, this list is consistently updated throughout the semester as you continue with other challenges and (hopefully!) encounter more resources. Your list must include multiple types of sources (aka, not just scholarly articles!) and must include at least 15 total sources. These resources should be relevant and comprehensive to your issue - not randomly selected because they happen to have select keywords. Make sure you are reviewing, skimming, or vetting these before adding them to your list. You will be choosing one or more of these resources to read, watch, or listen to.**</center>

For this challenge, I focused on resources that explained the history and context of poverty, with special regard for homelessness and food insecurity.

## Reflection Prompts

`What did you learn about your issue from this challenge?`

Creating effective legislation to fix problems is a massive problem that requires precise wording and fair implementation. The beginning of my research involved me understanding what the cause of homelessness, poverty, and food insecurity were. At a certain point, I had enough resources to start asking where the process of providing and creating solutions started. Looking at legislation, I read something that I feel is likely always true:

<quote>... the bill would require the development
of an established policy on affordable and fair 
housing at the county level to identify the goals
and objectives necessary to take meaningful actions 
that will “affirmatively further fair housing,” 
and the metrics with which counties would measure them. 
This assessment will resource demanding for local jurisdictions. 
If local jurisdictions cannot meet the demands 
of the bill, then they are not eligible for 
certain DHCD funding, which could serve 
to harm the jurisdictions with limited resources 
– the communities that need this funding the most.</quote>


`What was successful or least successful? Why?`

Something I realized very early on while looking for sources was that each source focused on trends for a specific area. I tried to figure out which local and regional trends could apply to the homeless and poor collectively, which I don't think was an effective use of time. That's why I later went back to the podcasts and news articles as a way of understanding context instead of trying to only apply data to a problem. 

`What might you do differently?`

I would have changed the way I started doing research. I think the most useful thing I did was look for key words and questions asked during podcasts, seminar recordings, and edited videos to create a mental map of what "the problem" is. If I could restart, I would have made a list of the things I knew and then looked up sources that would be the most true and real to what the experiences are for homeless and poor people.

`How will this challenge help you moving forward?`

The idea of checking my own internal narratives about the homeless and poor will help me a lot when I'm doing Phases 2 and 3. A big goal for me is that I want to be able to apply my understanding in a meaningful way and I think the ability to empathize effectively is a key part of that.

`What questions do you have after completing this challenge?`

What do the trends mean to experts in the field? 
Is it more effective to have many organizations solve homelessness in a small region, or to have a few global organizations focus on the whole world?
How do other systems (the justice system, technology, other public services) play into the homelessness, poverty, and food insecurity?

### Challenge 4: Dive Deep <a name="ch4"></a>

<center>**The Challenge: The final challenge in the Learn & Empathize phase is to choose one (or more) of the resources you’ve been building over the last few weeks and actually read, watch, or listen to it. If written, it should be at least 30-40 pages. If video or audio, it should be at least 2 hours (either by itself or combined). You must have your chosen resources approved prior. For your post, you must provide the sources you read/watched/listened to, and provide a 600-750 word summary of the source(s) and your biggest takeaways.**</center>

## Source Summary

For the deep dive, I chose to listen to a few episodes of [NCH's "Voices of the Homeless"](#nch-podcast). Each episode is about 45 minutes long, so I listened to 4 episodes for a total of **3 hours** of content.

Each episode is a conversation of real people's stories and experiences being homeless, and then a transition into invidual people's suggestions for solving homelessness.

Episode 1 was a good introduction for me into the experience of what it means to be homeless. Both guests, David Mizell and Joel Segal, discussed their backgrounds, why they became homeless, and how they secured housing. The key takeaway from this episode was just how different the causes are for homelessness. A lot of people assume that the cause is either drug abuse or poor decision making, which is true sometimes, but the point that leaders in the field are making is that those assumptions are not always the case, and the underlying beliefs that people justify with those assumptions aren't true. There were people from dysfunctional families, people from law school, orphans, and successful people with drug abuse conditions.

Joel Segal in [Episode 1](https://audioboom.com/posts/7870610-ep-1-having-mercy) referenced his privilege as making his homelessness a different experience than most. As a law student, he knew a lot of people that were able to provide for him and give him transportation and shelter while he was disabled. 

Joel Segal: "There has to be a national grassroots movement like what Martin Luther King Jr. led in the 60s. We need a movement that can get a bill passed in Congress that will provide cities and towns with billions of dollars to provide affordable housing for everyone who needs it, even if they don't have a penny."

Christina Garcia and Kelvin Lassiter in [Episode 2](https://audioboom.com/posts/7870622-ep-2-rise-above) both said "What was most helpful was having staff with lived experiences." Certain services have specific times or dates that people on the street can't really make time for the way that people with stable housing and jobs can. One thing I realized while listening to this is: just like how I can't expect everyone to understand my life as a minority, I can't expect to be more knowledgeable about homelessness than someone who experienced it myself. 

While listening, I saw some parallels with the sources from [Challenge 3](#ch3), especially with the idea that the amount of paperwork and time that it takes to house individuals is detrimental. When people are constantly on the move, it's ineffective to make people wait weeks or months to be able to fill out forms, find places, and wait on others to work with them.

There were multiple times throughout the podcast episodes that the host and guests explained how different systems influence homelessness. In [Episode 3](https://audioboom.com/posts/7891509-ep-3-i-don-t-feel-safe?playlist_direction=forward), there was an explanation that the foster care system contains over 250,000 children, many who will end up homeless after turning 18. That statistic made me ask if there were other government departments that were responsible for addressing how their work affects homelessness - it turns out every government department is a member of the [Interagency Council on Homelessness](https://www.usich.gov) which I am still doing research on.


One question asked during that episode was about child protection in relation to homelessness. The response from the guest was that the family of the guest wrote them off and ignored their requests for help after hearing of their homelessness and pregnancy. 

In [Episode 4](https://audioboom.com/posts/7908801-ep-4-what-happens-to-a-dream-deferred?playlist_direction=forward) the discussion was about law enforcement physically abusing people, how few resources public organizations have, support for the elderly, and more. The episode discussed the reality that some homeless people face physical harassment from law enforcement officers, which can make them feel unsafe even while they are in the process of getting housed. Both guests discussed their experiences with being housed and how even safe housing wasn't always stable due to poor conditions, unhelpful leadership, or erratic housemates.

With each episode showing me that theres so many factors behind each person's experience, I had to ask myself what it means to solve homelessness.

## Reflection Prompts

`What did you learn about your issue from this challenge?`

I was given specific examples of what homeless and poor people have to do to survive, the choices they have to make (living, income, etc.). A lot of the guests on the podcast discussed how they survived rape, living in dangerous environments, or how they generally had a lot of support getting to stable housing. I heard good suggestions concerning how to deal with homelessness, and also what problems are stopping the general public from increasing their understanding.

`What was successful or least successful? Why?`

This podcast helped me a lot to understand what gets people into and out of homelessness, and also what the experience is while homeless. The format made it very easy to tune into the stories and get why homelessness is difficult for people in different ways, and why a one-solution-fits-all approach assumes that all homeless poeple are the same.

I will say that I went into this podcast expecting to hear a lot about people were fighting homelessness, which made me miss a few key details when the guests were describing their experiences. I had to change that notion when I remembered that phase 1 was about understanding, which also involves hearing stories and being able to listen to people's first-hand experiences  

`What might you do differently?`

I would have gone into this podcast with a different mindset. 

`How will this challenge help you moving forward?`

This challenge gave me multiple human resources to look at for guidance in focusing my efforts - a lot of the speakers are members of nonprofits or write articles about the truth of homelessness, which I can reference to gain more first-hand knowledge.

More importantly, it reminded me that I'm doing research with the intent of understanding a system, not with the goal of providing a solution or being an expert. 

`What questions do you have after completing this challenge?`

What is being done to address the differences in experience for homeless people? What is it like for people in rural areas vs. in cities? Hot vs. cold? Can we address all of these things with "stable housing", or do regional differences drastically change how we help homeless people? What about mental disorders? Do we have resources for these people in jails, on the street, and for children and parents?
